The Simple Password Generator can be used to create simple passwords list which will create minimum number of possible combination of passwords using characters,integers,special symbols.
its a gui version so its simple to use , just enter a name or something and it will create passwords.
OR USE THE BRUTAL PASSWORD GENERATOR FOR MORE COMPLEX AND LONG PASSWORDS ALSO THINGS CAN BE CUSTOMISED LIKE PASS LENGHTH SIZE etc.
